# Project Description:
The project aims to develop a Python-based K-means clustering algorithm with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that can cluster a set of points into clusters using the K-means algorithm. The application will allow users to input a set of points and initial centroids (optional) and it will output the clusters of points with a graphical representation of the points in a 2D XY plan with circled clusters in red.

# Project Phases:

## **Phase 1: Planning**
In this phase, we will finalize the project scope, objectives, and requirements. We will develop a detailed project plan that outlines the project timeline, deliverables, and milestones.

Deliverables:
- Project scope document
- Project plan
- Risk assessment document

## **Phase 2: Design**
In this phase, we will design the software architecture, user interface, and data models. We will create a flowchart and diagrams to visualize the application's data flow, user interaction, and architecture.

Deliverables:
- Software architecture diagram
- Flowchart
- UI mockup

## **Phase 3: Development**
In this phase, we will implement the K-means clustering algorithm in Python and develop the GUI using Tkinter or PyQt. We will integrate the clustering algorithm with the GUI and test the application with sample datasets.

Deliverables:
- Source code
- Application executable
- Unit test reports

## **Phase 4: Testing**
In this phase, we will perform functional testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing to ensure the application meets the requirements and works as expected. We will identify and fix any defects found during testing.

Deliverables:
- Test plan
- Test reports

## **Phase 5: Deployment**
In this phase, we will deploy the application to production and provide user manuals and installation guides. We will also train the users on how to use the application.

Deliverables:
- Installation guide
- User manual
- Training documents

## **Conclusion:**
In conclusion, the K-means clustering algorithm with GUI in Python is an exciting project that can help users cluster a set of points into clusters with a graphical representation of the points in a 2D XY plan. The project plan outlines the different phases, deliverables, timeline, and budget required to develop this application. By following this project plan, we can successfully deliver a high-quality application that meets the user's requirements and expectations.
