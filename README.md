# K-Means-Clusterer 👨‍💻

A Python-based K-means clustering algorithm with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that can cluster a set of points into clusters using the K-means algorithm. The application allows users to input a set of points and initial centroids (optional) and outputs the clusters of points with a graphical representation of the points in a 2D XY plan with circled clusters in red.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:

```
python kmeans.py
```

4. Input the points and initial centroids (if any) in the GUI and click on the "Cluster" button.

5. The clusters of points will be displayed with a graphical representation of the points in a 2D XY plan with circled clusters in red.
